            5 Tips on Selecting the Right Recruiting Agency
        </h2>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Narrow down
                your search on those that fit your criteria</strong> </br>
                First and
                  foremost, what type of recruitment agency do you need? If it’s
                  a temporary or contractual worker, then a <strong>staffing agency</strong>  is
                  the best option. How about top-level executives? <strong>Headhunting
                  agencies</strong>  are best in that area. </br> </br> You have to remember that
                  there are <strong>niche agencies</strong>, too. As opposed to general ones,
                  this recruiter agency has the edge to find highly skilled
                  talents who truly specialize in their fields. Why? Because
                  they understand the talent gaps in the market and help fill
                  positions faster by providing candidates best suited for such
                  specialty roles.</br> </br> <strong> 2. Clearly explain your hiring needs</strong>
                </br> The
                  second step in selecting the perfect recruitment agency for
                  your business is to elaborate on what your organization needs.
                  It is best if you are as clear as possible about this so that
                  they have a clear idea of what type of talent that you need.</br> </br> 
                  Plan before contacting them. Do you need to fill only one
                  position? Or are there a lot? What role are you trying to
                  fill? Is it a permanent or temporary job? Is it entry or
                  management level? What kind of prior experience do you want
                  them to have? </br> </br> These basic questions will help the firms lead
                  you to the right talent accurately and precisely. Also, don’t
                  be afraid to talk about your company, as well. There are lots
                  of points to discuss:</br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Company background</li>
                    <li>Company mission and
                  vision statement</li>
                  <li>Company values</li><li>Existing corporate culture</li>
                  <li>Description of work environment.</li>
                  </ul> 
                   It may seem tedious to
                  expound on such topics, but best believe that they are
                  necessary if you truly want to get the best of the best in the
                  market.</br> </br> 
                  <strong>3. Interview the Recruitment Agency</strong> </br>
                    Don’t be shy to
                  interview the recruiting agency like they are the candidate
                  themselves. In the second step, you took the time for them to
                  get to know your company. Now, it’s your turn to probe more
                  about them. </br> </br> <strong>You can ask the following questions:</strong>  
                  <ul>
                    <li> How long has
                  the agency been running?</li>
                  <li>Who are you working for so far?</li>
<li>How
                  long does it take you to find the right talent?</li>
<li>What is your
                  hiring process?</li>
                  </ul>
                    All of these will give you an immediate
                  impression of whether or not they are capable of meeting your
                  needs. Think about such queries and dig deeper into their
                  background. This will reveal how prepared and professional
                  they are, as well.</br> </br> 
                  <strong>4. See how the recruiters work</strong><br>  Asking about
                  the agency is one thing, but knowing how their recruiters work
                  is another.</br> </br>  The fourth step in choosing the best recruitment
                  agency is checking the experience of their staff. There are
                  plenty of ways where you can go about this.</br> </br> 
                  You can talk to
                  them directly and ask what their methods are. What do they do
                  to pre-screen candidates? Is it in person or is it conducted
                  online or via phone?. </br> </br> 
                   You can also ask how they source
                  candidates. Seeking actively on platforms such as LinkedIn,
                  Facebook, and others are given. This is effective because you
                  know that there are individuals there looking for employment.
                  However, remember that they only represent a portion of the
                  talent market.</br> </br> 
                   A good recruiter knows that there are more
                  passive candidates in the world (70% as told by LinkedIn!),
                  and these individuals can bring higher ROI than active
                  candidates. They have more experience and they are what you
                  can say “in demand” in a way.</br> </br> 
                   The challenge is that they are
                  not really looking for a new job, but are interested in
                  hearing more about other opportunities elsewhere. If the
                  recruiter is capable, he/she will be able to convince them to
                  move eventually. Be sure to remember this!. </br> </br> 
                   You can also check
                  testimonials and feedback on the internet. For sure, there
                  will be reviews by clients stating their thoughts on working
                  with them. </br> </br> 
                  They are movers of the firm. They should be
                  strategic and persuasive enough to convince talent to join
                  your company.</br> </br> 
                  <strong>5. Ensure it’s within budget</strong><br>
                   This probably is a
                  no-brainer for businesses, but it's still important to
                  highlight. Once you feel that they tick the aforementioned
                  criteria, then check if you can afford their services. </br> </br> 
                  This is
                  a vital step to consider. You’re already well-assured that
                  they are able to provide you with high-quality talents, but
                  it’s just a matter of discussing numbers.</br> </br> 
                   Talk to your hiring
                  team and superiors about this. Will it be worth it? Is it
                  still within budget? How badly do you need to fill the
                  position? This can influence your decision.</br> </br> 
                   Alternatively, you
                  can look at the prices of their services beforehand. Some may
                  argue it’s a waste of time to get to know a recruitment agency
                  and their recruiters, then finding out they are way too
                  expensive. </br> </br>  You can get such information listed on their
                  website or via online reviews. You can also contact them
                  directly and ask this firsthand. Inquire about their services,
                  terms and conditions, and, again, pricing. </br> </br> Here’s a little
                  backgrounder to give more insights about the costs of working
                  with recruitment agencies. </br> </br> Now, the fees of a recruitment
                  agency also vary depending on the position you want to fill.
                  They take into account the following factors: 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Number of
                  positions to be filled</li>
                  <li>Type of industry to be filled</li>
                  <li>Type of
                  job position </li>
                  <li>Type of job hire (full-time, part-time, etc.)</li>
                  <li>The expected salary of the job position </li>
                  <li>… and many more.</li>
                  </ul>
                  It’s a tricky dilemma that will make or break your business.
                  Don’t take this lightly!.
