            Why work with a recruitment agency?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Time is of the essence, especially for businesses! You can’t
            fully function when you lack a member, after all. No need to
            panic because that’s where recruitment agencies come in. You
            have dedicated staff to assist you in your hiring efforts from
            start to finish. They’ll see to it that they successfully
            facilitate this important talent acquisition process. </br>
          </br>
            However,
            choosing the right firm to work with isn’t as easy as it
            seems. According to Murray Resources, there are over 20,000
            staffing and recruiting agencies in the United States -- plus
            a whole lot more around the globe! With so many choices
            available, you can’t just blindly pick one without knowing the
            criteria in making a profitable decision. That is why in this
            article, we’re compiling a list of everything you need to know
            when selecting a recruitment agency so you can meet your
            company objectives, and, at the same time, save valuable time
            and resources for the business. </br>
          </br>
            <h2>Recap: What is a Recruitment
            Agency?</h2> Before anything else, let’s align ourselves first with
            what we mean by a recruitment agency.</br> In a nutshell, it is a
            firm that acts as a medium between employers and employees.
            They are external recruiters that work with various companies
            and businesses to help them source, screen, and successfully
            hire candidates fit for the organization and, of course, the
            position. 
            </br></br>They are perfect to get in touch with, especially if
            your in-house recruiters are occupied and don’t have the time
            to procure top talents. This is a great idea to do because
            such firms do their best in searching for the right
            candidates. After all, they only get the commission once their
            suggested prospect is onboarded.</br></br> This allows you to avoid bad
            hires and those with low stick rates, which proves truly
            beneficial in terms of overall ROI. </br></br> To encapsulate the point,
            here are 3 main reasons why you should work with a recruitment
            agency. </br></br>
            <strong>1. It ultimately saves time for the company</strong> <br> SHRM
            conducted a vital report and stated that the average
            time-to-fill is 42 days. By working with recruitment agencies,
            you can cut down the days needed to get the talent that your
            company needs.</br> </br> Dedicated recruiters will find the right
            individual for the role as efficiently and effectively as
            possible through their broad network and resume database.
            Aside from sourcing, they’ll also handle most of the time
            consuming aspects of the recruiting process like screening,
            initial interviewing, etc. </br></br>Additionally, you can also reduce
            cost in some areas like job adverts posting, overtime cost,
            training cost, and more.</br></br> <strong>2. It helps you reach top talents</strong><br>
            With their undivided attention and better sourcing capacity,
            they take extra measures to source candidates across multiple
            platforms and screen them thoroughly.</br></br>Be it via phone
            interviews, assessment tests, and others, they make sure that
            only the ones that would be acceptable for your company would
            go through. They will weed out those who are not the right fit
            and only proceed with qualified people that can adapt to your
            organization’s goals and objectives.</br> </br>Plus, to connect it to
            the previous point, they can use the saved time to ensure
            quality candidates are screened properly and without rush.<br><br>
            <strong>3.
              It helps recruiting talents in high demand verticals</strong><br>
            Oftentimes, people work with recruitment agencies to seek
            assistance for hard-to-fill positions. It may not be a matter
            of time restraint, but rather the fierce competition over
            certain positions. </br></br> This goes especially for senior level
            positions or high demand fields like technology, digital,
            marketing, hospitality, etc. A lot of companies are fighting
            over the best of the best, and it takes great skills to do so.
          </br> </br>
            Recruiters of such recruitment agencies are trained to
            negotiate well and convince candidates to be onboard.  Their
            accrued experience in the matter helps them get better each
            time, as well.
